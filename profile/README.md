## About Us

Brender Labs is a dedicated organization focused on the research and development of products related to 3D rendering in the cloud using Blender. Our journey began as a response to the scarcity of information available regarding 3D rendering in the cloud using AWS and Serverless systems. Our primary objective is to provide essential solutions and concepts that simplify the adoption of these technologies, making it more accessible for individuals, small studios, and companies to efficiently create their own solutions.

Thank you for your interest in Brender Labs!
